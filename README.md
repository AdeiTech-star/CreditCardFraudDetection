# CreditCardFraudDetection

Data from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv

Our model(Logistic regression) had a 96% accuracy. I will be testing on more models to see which model performs better.
Since we initially had an imbalanced dataset and we undersmpled, I'll be testing out oversampling and using a SMOTE technique to see how the model will do in that regard. Or test out RandomForest model instead since it works well in imbalanced datasets :)
